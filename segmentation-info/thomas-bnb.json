    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "it was just up to the fact that it was back in i think it's twenty nineteen that i bought i bought the course that was like at the beginning of covid the thing is right before covid started i actually took some steps you actually start the airbnb business but the thing is because of covid and the fact that i didn't have a car at a time and not enough time on my side i kind of you know sat back and just let that go i was like oh i don't wanna deal with the the complications so i'm thinking oh i'll put another travel as much because the virus never else so i just went on and just left the the the that business idea and put it on the side mhmm now it's twenty twenty two i have i do have a car now and you know i've been working full time and everything else so now i'm more looking for do it myself because i did i did go to like two different two different landlords one of them didn't like it because she was all she was managing multiple properties and the other person well the place was not suitable for that so that's the other thing so it's as if you know it's always be at the back of my head then i wanna try the regular arbitrage yep that's why"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "gotcha okay and then what has you most about the or what has you most excited to say about the airbnb business model"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "i guess learning how to talk to the landlords and you know get my really my first lease like on my own yeah i think those are the two things really"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "gotcha okay and then in terms of your journey in the airbnb you said you you did some stuff before covid where are you at so far in the journey like currently"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "currently i mean i have i mean i don't know i guess because right now i don't have any any property or any legal or anything like that and i guess the biggest thing is learning where to like to find the best properties i guess because in boston here it's pretty pretty expensive around here so the like the red and everything else so yeah"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "gotcha okay okay cool so that's kind of a challenge you've been running into it sounds like finding the the best properties now now really alright my my job here is to get your results mhmm and in order to do that i need to know what results means for you so let's start here what's your ideal income like perfect world no boundaries"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "with no boundary my ideal income per year mhmm oh no i i have this arbitrary number in the back of my head like four hundred k a year okay that's what that's about to go through my head"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "gotcha why that number"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "right oh why that number mhmm because i just think it's just like you're just not gonna be wanting for anything really if you're making that kind of money and you're also responsible because i only got that point you know okay anything extra is just a bonus not anything that you need to do it's just okay you have it to buy yeah"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "yeah that makes sense well i think four hundred k a year is a solid goal that we can talk together now i really are so first step in achieving a goal like four hundred k a year is knowing with one hundred percent search engine as possible and you know obviously when i hear four hundred k a year i know it's extremely realistic just because out of all the students we have i get to see it happen time and time again by people who honestly are not much different than you with that said do you personally believe four hundred k years possible for you like not meaning you have to know how to get there just that it's not completely impossible"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "oh i think it's possible but i think it's my my goal was more like over a period of time right not like it was all just suddenly one year you're just making fun of it no it's just like oh you're working towards multiple different skills so that you can apply and invest into all this is make that kind of money so yeah i believe it is possible if i work at it"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "okay and say you get to four hundred k a year will you completely stop there"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "when i what"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "will you completely stop at four hundred k a year"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "probably not if i can make that much probably that"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "yeah where do you wanna get to beyond four hundred like what number you know that is possible or you don't know how to get there yet"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "yeah i just don't know how to"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 3,
    "transcript": "get there because i think"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "if i if i can build myself to a point where i'm making phone with a check especially i'm not trying to do it like in the like going to a job by creating my own opportunities alright so at that point i will know how to make the money so i should be able to make more if i'm just not lazy i just keep working at it and i need more skills or whatever so that should be that should be a given"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "and so what is that number for you beyond four hundred it's gonna stretch you even more it's gonna excite you like where is that never beyond four hundred k a year"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "oh that excites me i i can say if i even if i go beyond that at that point it's not like it's a necessary thing i feel like if i reach a foreign ticket that would be like i guess a comfortable place to be i'm not really looking for like you know some riches or whatever that's you know mhmm for the kids a lot of money so i was just like yeah that's because i have a simple guy so i i don't really need more than that but i would go for more just because i can not because i need to mhmm you know what i'm saying yeah that makes sense"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "yeah and you know ours the reason that i'm asking these questions here to help you expand this vision a little bit is because there's this principle of like hedging right and so if the goal of the target is four hundred k a year that's what you wanna hit and if we shoot for eight hundred k a year just for example it's much easier to hit four hundred k a year when you're going for eight hundred k right because even if you fail miserably and you only hit fifty percent of your goal you still hit four hundred k a year right so i find cities bigger goals that way you can attack this eight hundred k whatever it is you tack that and then along that way you negatively accomplish four hundred k and just take a given it's not am i gonna do it am i not it's a given"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "i see what you so"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "that being said i'd recommend we set a target beyond form okay and it's not like oh i need to get there absolutely but it's like eight hundred k or six hundred k or whatever it is is the goal i'm gonna shoot for because that's gonna guarantee i hit four hundred k"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "i see okay yeah that actually makes sense i didn't think about it"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "mhmm so let's go ahead and and set that target for you that's gonna go over four hundred k to guarantee you hit that so what number do you wanna set for that between the six hundred three hundred seven hundred"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "let's put it to a million then let's put it"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "to a million okay"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "because then that's better i can just go for that"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "yeah alright i like what we're thinking now million dollars a year of course so that's i think the supercell goal we can attack together and i just wanna double clarify we're both comfortable with that right"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "yes"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "okay so this conversation is gonna be based around that million a year that's where we're gonna go for it's gonna guarantee you hit four hundred k so the million a year you know really like i said the first step is knowing it's possible and knowing apps associated it is and so do you believe that's actually possible to hit a million a year"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "yes i think so especially if she can get a bunch of properties i mean"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "yeah yeah"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "it's gonna take it's gonna take time obviously in work but it's it's possible it's just like are you gonna keep working or are you gonna stop"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "yeah and why do you believe it's possible"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "yes i believe it's possible"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "a second"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "how much do i believe it mhmm well because part of because the thing too is like i've been in different programs and i've you know one different kinds of people the more people grow let's say i started and i'll make it like a hundred for a year alright at some point i'm gonna need some kind of help and i can actually hire coaches or mentors to help me go forward so it's not it's like i think part of it is like a mental block for a lot of people like you were saying if you go for a higher goal it's easier to reach the goal that you actually want and if you just set that goal and just you know go for that it's the mental thing more so than an actual physical thing so like i think that it's possible because if you have the right coaches the right man to the right people around you that could actually you know give you tips and tricks in the wall and stuff to guide you to where you need to be so it's not just like a a singular effort but it's more like you you put in the effort first and learn the skill and everything else but when you need to scale you'll you'll you will reinvest in yourself basically with these people so what"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "happens gotcha why do you believe in mentorship"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 3,
    "transcript": "i believe in that because first of"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "all i don't even have the kind of experience that a lot of people have in business so i believe in spending the money to get the knowledge"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "mhmm"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "and the the motivation because if you know that this person that you're talking to has this many properties and they're making what you wanna make they'll know what to do so they could teach you that and you just have to take the steps now that that it comes out of the courage take the steps and do it"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "mhmm and so do you feel like you would succeed faster did you have that"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "yes yeah because a lot of people don't spend the money because there's things that they can do it by themselves all the way through which is possible but if you spend money you which i mean it goes faster"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "yeah and why is that valuable for you to go faster"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "why is that what"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "why is that valuable and valuable to you to go faster"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "oh yeah well because i have parents that i really want to retire i want i don't want them to work all of them they're working all the time i want to give them a easier life at least while i'm while they're still alive and while i'm alive and i'm young i wanna give them that so that they don't have to worry about having to work if they wanna work they can work but having to do it and you just stop working and they can't you know pay for their bills or their retirement for that but if i could be the one to provide that that will be a blessing that's that's one of the main reasons why i wanna do this"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "well it's so powerful man that's so powerful and i we'll dive into that a little bit more in a minute here one of the reasons is to make the million dollars a year a little bit more practical one of the reasons that i feel confident is because every single two bedroom property you add is about twenty four thousand a year added in net income and so this"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "okay"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "into a million a year really doesn't require a lot of properties especially considering the strategies to lock in ten to twenty at a time"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "okay mhmm so each one you say would give you twenty four thousand each property about -- that's right"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "--"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "that much"

  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "yeah"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "mhmm whoa okay and that means like ten properties you could be able to make familiar oh wait i think two hundred forty"

  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "yeah"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "and you have more yeah and you have more you could go in from there"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "mhmm exactly yeah i can tell man you're you're quick with this you definitely have the the intelligence and and everything to succeed with us which is which is awesome to see now rich be completely realistic to me here how long do you think it'll take for you to get to a million dollars a year on your own"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "on my own if i'm resilient oh let's say okay we're in february right now by the end of this year i should be able to get maybe at least three properties on four by myself"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 2,
    "transcript": "mhmm"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "three that that's probably a stretch because i don't i've i've been i went to the landlords whatever it's kind of i got that comfortable with the pieces yet but three is probably kind of a realistic number by the end of this year mhmm"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 2,
    "transcript": "so if you"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "say it was three times twenty four one seventy two thousand but that's not gonna be the full amount this year yet but that would take me a while to get there i would say two three years"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "two to three years yeah yeah no that makes sense well you know ours is based off of what i've seen and specifically for you if i still look at a crystal clear path to a million a year in say eighteen months and i knew for a hundred percent fact we can make it happen for you i mean it just made logical sense would you be willing to make that your goal that scenario"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "yeah actually i will give it a try"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "and when you say you give it a try it sounds like that's different than being committed to making that your goal so mhmm alright because there's kind of two mentalities you can approach it with the the mentality of this is based off of liberty i work with hundreds of students subscents happen a lot i see how our seven figure students think and their mentality towards approaching this especially when they're getting started is like they decided they just they wanna make this amount of money they're like alright now we gotta figure it out but they decided first like you make the decision before you have the pathway right so they make the decision then they found the help they found the guidance that's on the pathway versus the people who because you know a lot"

    "speaker": 1,

    "speaker": 0,
    "transcript": "with seven figures not a lot of people accomplish it why is that yeah the people who don't accomplish it they say well you know that'd be cool if i had seven figures that'd be cool that'd be nice or you know it'd be cool i i'll like you know i'll do what i can to get there but the mentality towards it is the mentality of if it happens it happens versus the mentality of the winners of the seven figure students which i feel like you're that type of person dur mentality is i'm gonna make it happen i'm committed to making this happen so for you are you the place where you're willing mindset that winter mindset of like i'm going to make this happen i'll figure it out i'll figure out the path i'll get the help i need like i'm gonna make this happen"
  },
  {
    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "yeah right now that's what i wanna do like i wanna make it happen i wanna go out there like right now i'm literally planning to go out there already and try to get new properties literally talk to a lot of landlords so i wanna make it happen"

    "speaker": 1,
    "transcript": "at that point yes i have retired my parents i paid off my student loans i have not i'm no longer concerned about any debt i could go basically anywhere and probably i have more at that point at a bigger home with more comfortable surroundings and everything else you know i have a different car more experiences yeah it'd just be overall happier and freer because i don't i'm not tied down by you know any expectations any outside expectations of being successful because that's what i am successful having made a million dollars continually working but working so that i can help other people also learn the skills and become financially free as well yeah at that point that is a pretty sweet life i gotta say"
